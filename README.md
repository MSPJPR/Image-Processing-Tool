Key Features

1. File Input for Images:

Users can upload images directly from their device using the <input> file element.



2. Canvas for Image Display:

Uploaded images are displayed on a canvas element, which serves as the workspace for processing.



3. Adjustments:

Brightness and Contrast Sliders: Fine-tune the image's brightness and contrast values interactively.



4. Filters:

Grayscale Filter: Converts the image to shades of gray.

Sepia Filter: Applies a warm, vintage-style effect.

Invert Filter: Inverts the image colors.

5. Reset Functionality:
